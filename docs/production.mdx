# Production Build

Debugging features and deprecation warnings can be turned off for production builds. Hyperdom source code checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable, and when set to `production` will turn these features off.

To make a production build with webpack, use `webpack -p`.

To make a production build with browserify, use [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) and ensure `NODE_ENV=production`, for e.g. `browserify -t [ envify --NODE_ENV production  ] ...` and then use a minifier like [uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) to strip the disabled code.
