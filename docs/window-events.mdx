# Window Events

You can attach event handlers to `window`, such as `window.onscroll` and `window.onresize`. Return a `windowEvents()` from your render function passing an object containing the event handlers to attach. When the window vdom is shown, the event handlers are added to `window`, when the window vdom is not shown, the event handlers are removed from `window`.

E.g. to add an `onresize` handler:

```js
var windowEvents = require('hyperdom/windowEvents');

class App {
  render() {
    return <div>
      width = {window.innerWidth}, height = {window.innerHeight}
      {
        windowEvents({
          onresize: () => console.log('resizing')
        })
      }
    )
  }
}
```
