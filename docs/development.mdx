# Development

To get started:

```js
git clone https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom.git
cd hyperdom
npm install
```

Some of the scripts below assume that you have `node_modules/.bin` in your `$PATH`.

## Building

`hyperdom.js` and `hyperdom.min.js` can be build using `npm run build`, these can then be used in a `<script src="..."></script>` tag.

## Automated Testing

Hyperdom is almost 100% tested with karma and mocha. If you're planning to submit a pull request, we kindly ask that you write a test that demonstrates that it works. Without tests, we can't guarantee that your feature will continue to work as we refactor the codebase.

Tests can be found in [test/browser/hyperdomSpec.js](https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom/blob/master/test/browser/hyperdomSpec.js).

You can run karma by running `karma start`, it will watch your files and rerun the tests every time they change.

Server-side tests can be found in [test/server](https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom/tree/master/test/server). You can use `mocha test/server` to run these.

To run all tests use `npm test`.

## Manual Testing

As much as automated testing is amazing, it can never really replace manual or exploratory testing. You may want to experiment with an API or see how hyperdom performs in a real project, while making changes to hyperdom as you go.

To do this, first go to the `hyperdom` directory and run `npm link`. This will make hyperdom available to other projects.

Then inside your other project run `npm link hyperdom`. When your project has `require('hyperdom')` it will be referring to your local version.

You can then use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify): `browserify myapp.js > myappbundle.js` or [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify): `watchify myapp.js -dvo myappbundle.js`, or [amok](https://github.com/caspervonb/amok): `amok --compiler babel --browser chrome myapp.js`, or [beefy](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/beefy): `beefy myapp.js`. [browserify-middleware](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/browserify-middleware) is worth a look too.

Alternatively, if you just want to compile `hyperdom.js` and reference it in a `<script src="..."></script>`, you can by running `npm run prepublish` in the hyperdom directory.
